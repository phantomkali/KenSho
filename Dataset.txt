Dream: The guy that I have been dating was standing in his room naked with one of his housemates who is a girl, and someone whom he has previously slept with. She was lying on the floor, also naked. I walked into the room and as I saw them, they both told me not to worry, that nothing was going on. I believed them and said, "OK," and walked out of the room.
Interpretation: The presence of both your date and his housemate being naked can symbolize vulnerability and openness. In dreams, nudity often reflects feelings of exposure or insecurity, possibly indicating concerns about intimacy or trust in your relationship. The fact that the girl is someone he has previously slept with may suggest underlying fears or anxieties regarding past relationships and their impact on your current relationship. This could reflect feelings of jealousy or insecurity. Both individuals telling you not to worry and your acceptance of that reassurance may indicate a desire to trust your partner and a willingness to overlook potential red flags. It could also signify a conflict between your intuition and your desire to maintain harmony in the relationship. Your decision to walk out after hearing their reassurances might symbolize avoidance or a coping mechanism in dealing with uncomfortable emotions. This action could reflect a tendency to sidestep conflict rather than confront it directly. Using Freud's approach, this dream may reveal several latent themes. The dream could be expressing subconscious fears about fidelity and trust within your relationship. Seeing your partner with an ex can evoke feelings of inadequacy or fear of being replaced. Your acceptance of their words suggests a yearning for reassurance and stability in the relationship, highlighting an internal struggle between doubt and trust. Walking out might indicate a desire to escape from uncomfortable situations rather than address them head-on, suggesting potential issues in communication within the relationship.

It may also reflect concerns about how others are affected by these challenges. Using Freud's approach to dream interpretation, this dream may reveal several latent themes. The combination of starting classes and the chaotic ocean scene suggests underlying anxiety about managing new responsibilities and expectations. The sea animal's terrorizing presence may symbolize fears associated with these changes. Your initial confidence in your knowledge contrasts sharply with the chaotic imagery of the ocean and the threatening sea animal.

A patient on the ward named Kabot appeared in the dream and said they were filling the smokestack. He had a motorcycle which he drove away in saying that he tended the grounds.

Dream: I come into a restaurant with my "family" - there's not many people here - it's small and cozy - we've been here before - I have a small bag with me, I think it's awkward to be bringing it in here, especially since I've also got another small suitcase that's old-looking, with a stripe and a makeshift handle on the end rather than in the middle. We sit at a small table and start a conversation with the waiter. There's some disagreement here but not major - I'm the one going somewhere to stay, like, say, I was going to grammaâ€™s for the summer - so I feel odd man out. The waiter brings wine - for some reason it's an incredibly expensive bottle (like on the TV show I saw last night) and it wasn't exactly bought - maybe a gift - maybe this is an anniversary dinner for "Mom" and "Dad". I remark on the new arrangement of the tables - different sizes, even, from the last time we were here - now all little round ones scattered around. They think I'm wrong, but I know where we sat last time. There's an interval and "Dad" and "little brother" go somewhere - I'm talking to "Mom", who's sitting on a couch - I decide this is a moment that calls for the wine, so I pour 2 glasses - one for her, one for him - I don't want any. I take it to her, saying I thought this was the moment for an incredibly, (something, something) - even embarrassingly - expensive - glass of wine. She's surprised at first, very dubious as to whether to drink it, it's so expensive. I'm thinking, what are you going to do with it?

Philip was there, but I can't remember why. At one point, Sam tried to get me a crayon so I could play, and I think Philip was jealous. The rink was the deepest shade of green I have ever seen (or imagined). And the "ice" was yellow.

Dream: I had the worst dream last night. It started out that I was at a party somewhere in some basement, at my college, but at a place that definitely doesn't actually exist. It was a huge labyrinth and very dingy and dimly lit. At the beginning, the party was fun. People were playing Beirut and there was music. I think it might have been a costume party because I think I was wearing a bumblebee or some other bug costume. Erick was there looking for me. I couldn't find him, but everyone else I saw told me he was looking for me. I saw notes written by him looking for me, notes like, "Bea, meet me upstairs." Anyway, the dream turned into a nightmare very quickly. All of a sudden we were running away from the building. It was daylight outside. People were screaming and running in every direction to avoid these gigantic machine monsters that were shooting people down like in District 9. Nora and I were trying to hide underneath a white plastic tarp. I was breathing so quickly and was so scared. I heard the machine's voice saying, "I can see your blue shoe underneath that white tarp. Come out now." I wondered if just maybe Nora was wearing blue shoes too, but she wasn't, and I knew the monster was calling for me. I waited until I thought maybe he had gone and then ran out to find my next hiding spot. I hid behind a wooden shed, but the second I peered around to see where the monster was, it shot me in the arm. It was really painful! I thought for sure I was going to die. All of a sudden I was lying on a gurney and being rushed back into the basement, which was no longer the site of a party, but a makeshift hospital. I couldn't move or speak, but I could hear the "doctors" around me saying I had almost no time to live, and discussing how they should take my organs now while they were still fresh. I was horrified and tried to speak to tell them that I was going to be fine, but they started draining blood and taking my organs. I don't remember the gory details, but I woke up in the same position (in my dream) after they had supposedly taken all my body parts. When I came to, however, I felt fine, as if nothing had happened. Even my costume was still intact. I was so happy I leapt off the gurney and raced around following the notes Erick had left me until I ran straight into him. I was so happy, but he looked terrified. He said we had to get out of here immediately. He brought me to some beautiful library with dark paneled walls, gorgeous built in shelves, and thousands and thousands of books. There were beautiful leather chairs, brass desk lamps, and huge skylights for the roof. It was dark and snowy outside, but cozy and warm inside. My whole family was there watching some National Geographic program about Siberian tigers. I started chatting online with Erick and some other friends. What was weird was that Erick was able to talk to me, but it was as if my other friends were ignoring me. I told Erick this and he said, "It's because you're dead." I distinctly remember my heart dropping as I realized this. He said that the only reason I could see him too was because the same thing had happened to him after he had been shot, and since we were both dead, we were on "the other side" and could talk to each other, but people who were still alive couldn't hear us. I guess I thought my family had been too absorbed in the TV to say anything to me when I got home, so I tried to see if they would acknowledge me now. I tried talking to my mother and brother separately, and then yelling at the top of my lungs "I AM GOING TO KILL MYSELF" to see if that would get their attention. But Erick seemed to be right; they just couldn't hear me. I started crying and ran upstairs, which was my room, even though we don't have a library like that in our house. I found my hairbrush, which I also knew to be some kind of sniper rifle, and ran into my room to shoot myself. If I died again, it means I was actually alive, but if nothing happened, then I must be dead. It was the most horrifying feeling and I kept trying to wake myself up. I literally said to myself "Bea, wake up! Wake up! This can't be real!" I looked into my full-length mirror and shot myself in the temple twice. I heard the gunshot and felt the excruciating pain, but got up right after I had shot myself. I started sobbing, since I was really dead. I ran back to the basement where all that stuff had happened, hoping to find someone who could bring me back to life. I was crying and screaming and trying to find anyone who would listen to me for just a minute. I hadn't said goodbye to anyone, and all I needed was a few days on "the other side" so I could talk to the living. It was so horrible, and every time I tried to wake myself up, I couldn't, so I just decided that I must have not been dreaming. And then I woke up, thank GOD! Interpretation: this vivid dream encapsulates complex emotions surrounding fear, connection, and the exploration of one's subconscious mind.

Dream: I had three walruses and we went somewhere to get across the river to get to the other side where the place was we had to swim. Well there was crocodiles in the river so when we swam across the crocodile ate the mother and the baby. And so all I had was the father and I got bit on the finger and then we went through a tunnel and the crocodiles were chasing after us. Then I said "Hal," and they stopped and I said "get out there on that river and leave people alone." Then me and the walrus got home and I asked the walrus "where's the baby and momma," and he pointed to a direction that was back at that place where the crocodiles were and he said, "the crocodiles ate them".

Dream: The guy that I have been dating was standing in his room naked with one of his housemates who is a girl, and someone whom he has previously slept with. She was lying on the floor, also naked. I walked into the room and as I saw them, they both told me not to worry, that nothing was going on. I believed them and said, "OK," and walked out of the room.
Interpretation: 
The presence of both your date and his housemate being naked can symbolize vulnerability and openness. In dreams, nudity often reflects feelings of exposure or insecurity, possibly indicating concerns about intimacy or trust in your relationship. The fact that the girl is someone he has previously slept with may suggest underlying fears or anxieties regarding past relationships and their impact on your current relationship. This could reflect feelings of jealousy or insecurity. Both individuals telling you not to worry and your acceptance of that reassurance may indicate a desire to trust your partner and a willingness to overlook potential red flags. It could also signify a conflict between your intuition and your desire to maintain harmony in the relationship. Your decision to walk out after hearing their reassurances might symbolize avoidance or a coping mechanism in dealing with uncomfortable emotions. This action could reflect a tendency to sidestep conflict rather than confront it directly. Using Freud's approach, this dream may reveal several latent themes. The dream could be expressing subconscious fears about fidelity and trust within your relationship. Seeing your partner with an ex can evoke feelings of inadequacy or fear of being replaced. Your acceptance of their words suggests a yearning for reassurance and stability in the relationship, highlighting an internal struggle between doubt and trust. Walking out might indicate a desire to escape from uncomfortable situations rather than address them head-on, suggesting potential issues in communication within the relationship.

Dream: It was the first day of classes for the quarter and I had the feeling that I was caught up with the workload and felt good about my knowledge of the class material. Then I was at the ocean and a sea animal was terrorizing the people and then she was caught.
Interpretation: Starting a new academic quarter often symbolizes new beginnings, opportunities for growth, and feelings of anticipation. Your confidence in your knowledge suggests a sense of preparedness and optimism about facing new challenges. The ocean often represents the unconscious mind, emotions, and the vastness of experiences. It can symbolize both tranquility and chaos, depending on the context. In this case, it may reflect feelings of being overwhelmed or threatened by external circumstances. The sea animal could symbolize fears or anxieties that feel out of control or threatening. This could represent external pressures in your life, such as academic stress or personal challenges that seem to disrupt your peace. The phrase "she was caught" could indicate feelings of being trapped or overwhelmed by circumstances beyond your control. It may also reflect concerns about how others are affected by these challenges. Using Freud's approach to dream interpretation, this dream may reveal several latent themes. The combination of starting classes and the chaotic ocean scene suggests underlying anxiety about managing new responsibilities and expectations. The sea animal's terrorizing presence may symbolize fears associated with these changes. Your initial confidence in your knowledge contrasts sharply with the chaotic imagery of the ocean and the threatening sea animal. This duality may reflect an internal conflict where you feel prepared yet anxious about potential obstacles. The focus on other people being terrorized may indicate a concern for how your challenges affect those around you, suggesting a sense of responsibility or empathy towards others' struggles.
Dream: This dream is very vague to me. I am in a house and I don't recognize it. The children that I work with at the preschool on campus are with me. I see my sister and I have the feeling that I am about to meet new people.

Houses in dreams often represent the self or the mind, so an unrecognized house could indicate exploring new aspects of your identity or current life circumstances.

This could reflect your feelings about your role in their lives and your emotional connection to them. Seeing your sister may symbolize familial ties, support, or shared experiences. It could indicate a desire for connection or reassurance from family as you navigate new situations. Anticipating meeting new people can represent openness to new experiences and relationships. This feeling may reflect a desire for social interaction or personal growth. Using Freud's approach to dream interpretation, this dream may reveal several latent themes. The unrecognized house may reflect a phase of self-discovery or change in your life. You might be grappling with new roles or responsibilities, especially related to your work with children. The presence of the preschool children suggests a strong nurturing aspect of your personality. This could indicate that you are seeking fulfillment through caring for others while also reflecting on your own needs. Your sister's presence and the anticipation of meeting new people highlight a longing for connection and support during transitions in your life. This could signify a need for social interaction as you navigate changes.

Anxiety about Responsibility: The dream reflects significant anxiety regarding your responsibilities toward the children. Your fear of them drowning symbolizes a fear of failure or inadequacy in fulfilling your role as a caregiver.

Dream:
In your dream, you start by researching in a library that closes early, forcing you to leave for lunch. The dining hall is enormous, reminiscent of Grand Central Station, where you encounter Gary performing a dance while you get raspberry and mandarin orange flavored avocados. A live band plays in the background.Suddenly, you find yourself in New York babysitting a boy named Preston. His friends arrive, including a brown-haired girl and an older German boy with a cute older brother who asks you to watch his brother for an hour. After giving up on finding Preston, you focus on the German boy until his brother returns from getting coffee. You all take the train back to your schoolâ€™s state.The scene shifts again, and now you're living in an apartment across the street from Jennifer Garner's classroom. Ben Stiller lives with you and wants to visit Jennifer. They meet on the street, and she adores his poodle, Fluffy; they plan to meet later for ice cream. However, a train crashes into your apartment, causing chaos as you and your mother scramble to escape. In the commotion, Fluffy goes missing, but you find your other pets, Skye and Fritz.As you step outside, the cute German boy sees you, and his mother mistakenly thinks you're Swedish. Your brother is nearby by the train wreck, prompting your parents to drive over to retrieve him. He tries to impress Francine and her friends by climbing into the car through the window backwards.

1. Fear of Loss and Responsibility:

2. Navigating Social Situations:
â€¢	The large dining hall filled with people highlights feelings of being overwhelmed in social settings, particularly when trying to connect with others (like Gary dancing). This suggests a desire for connection amidst chaos.
3. Shifts in Control:
â€¢	Transitioning from babysitting Preston to focusing on the German boy reflects feelings of shifting responsibilities or priorities in your life. It may symbolize a desire to help others while grappling with feelings of inadequacy or confusion.
4. Romantic Aspirations:
â€¢	The interactions with Ben Stiller and Jennifer Garner hint at aspirations or fantasies surrounding relationships and social dynamics. The playful nature of their meeting indicates a longing for lighthearted connections.
5. Chaos and Disruption:
â€¢	The train crashing into your apartment represents sudden disruptions in life that feel uncontrollable. This could symbolize external pressures or unexpected challenges that interfere with your sense of stability.
6. Fear of Judgment:
â€¢	Your brother's attempt to show off suggests concerns about how others perceive you or your family dynamics in social situations. This may reflect insecurities regarding self-image or familial expectations.
7. Identity Confusion:
â€¢	The German boyâ€™s mother mistaking you for Swedish could indicate feelings of being misunderstood or misrepresented in social contexts, highlighting anxieties about identity.
8. Coping with Anxiety:
â€¢	The chaotic elements throughout the dreamâ€”lost pets, train wrecksâ€”may symbolize underlying anxiety about control and safety in your environment. Your brother's backward entry into the car suggests attempts to navigate challenges creatively but also highlights feelings of awkwardness or discomfort.
In summary, this dream encapsulates themes of fear of loss, navigating social dynamics, shifting responsibilities, romantic aspirations, chaos and disruption in life, fear of judgment from others, identity confusion, and coping with anxiety. It reflects an emotional landscape filled with both desires for connection and challenges related to self-perception and familial relationships as you navigate complex situations in waking life.
